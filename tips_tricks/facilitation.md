# Facilitation Tips
We highly recommend checking out Liberating Structures. Going through the questions with a group of people is highly encouraged - using Liberating Structures your experience will not suffer even if more people will join in.

Check out the official [Libearting Structures Homepage](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/).
We also highly recommend the blog posts by [The Liberators](https://medium.com/the-liberators/liberating-structures/home) about many Liberating Structures and their use in the context of Scrum.
