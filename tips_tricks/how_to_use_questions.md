# How to use the Questions
Some Info on how to use the questions? PSM 1/2/3 assessments. CoPs? Internal Trainings etc.

Grab your team, your community of practice or whatever other learning group you have and try to improve your practice together.
Katas are great to also try out new practices - just like as a software developer you can use Coding Dojos to try TDD, Pair- or Mob-Programming, you can use these questions to practice different facilitation techniques.
