# Improve your Skills by continuously challenge and push your Scrum Mastery Skills

For helping software developers continuously work on their craft there exist coding dojos where a group of craftspeople will solve katas together.
Why not do the same thing as Agile Coach or Scrum Master? Grab your team, your community of practice or whatever other learning group you have and try to improve your practice together.
Katas are great to also try out new practices - just like as a software developer you can use Coding Dojos to try TDD, Pair- or Mobprogramming, you can use these questions to practice different facilitation techniques.
Why not try out how that Liberating Structure works for this or how the whole exercise could work in remote setups?

We've got you covered with the questions, now go out there and practice!
