# Scrum Kata
For helping software developers continuously work on their craft there exist coding dojos where a group of craftspeople will solve katas together.
Why not do the same thing as Agile Coach or Scrum Master?

Don't wait and start to improve your Skills by continuously challenge and push your Scrum Mastery Skills.

We've got you covered with the questions, now go out there and practice!

# How to use the Questions
Some Info on how to use the questions? PSM 1/2/3 assessments. CoPs? Internal Trainings etc.

Grab your team, your community of practice or whatever other learning group you have and try to improve your practice together.
Katas are great to also try out new practices - just like as a software developer you can use Coding Dojos to try TDD, Pair- or Mob-Programming, you can use these questions to practice different facilitation techniques.

# Facilitation Tips
We highly recommend checking out Liberating Structures. Going through the questions with a group of people is highly encouraged - using Liberating Structures your experience will not suffer even if more people will join in.

Check out the official [Libearting Structures Homepage](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/).
We also highly recommend the blog posts by [The Liberators](https://medium.com/the-liberators/liberating-structures/home) about many Liberating Structures and their use in the context of Scrum.

# Submit your Questions
Do you have some nice question to share with the community? Fill in the form below and you will head over to github (you'll need a github account) to submit your question.
If you have a bigger set of questions to provide you can also reach out directly via [email](mailto:benj.huser@gmail.com) and we can add them.

## Important
Please only submit questions that can be shared publically. If they are copyrighted (maybe they are part of a training) we cannot use them here.
If you have the copyright on the questions you can also let us know and we could add some statements and/or links together with your questions.
