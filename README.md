# Scrum Kata
Scrum Kata is a hobby project by professional Scrum Masters [Benji Huser](https://github.com/huserben) and [Henadz Kavaliou](https://github.com/henadzkavaliou).
While preparing for the PSM-III assessment, we tried to answer questions around Scrum in a practice group and discussed them together afterwards.
In the complex domain, there is rarely a single answer for a problem, and in the discussions we had, we learned about the different angles all those potential problems could be tackled.

We also realized that we came up with many questions that we'd like to share with the community so others can use them for their assessment preparation or just to work on their Scrum Master skills.

Our current product goal is to provide a question library for all to use. In future, this might change - if you have good ideas, let us know!

# Feedback
We're eager to live up to the pillars of empiricism and would love to hear your feedback. From bugs and general questions to feature requests - we're curious to hear from you!

We're not making money with this and have no intention to monetize this in any way in the future. We're trying our best to answer as fast as possible. But please be mindful that this is not always at the highest on our backlog as we have our regular jobs and lives away from Scrum Kata.

# Open Source
Scrum Kata is for the community, that's why we also host the whole project on [GitHub](https://github.com/huserben/scrum-kata) under an MIT license.
Feel free to contribute, either by submitting your questions or by directly creating Pull Requests. We'd be delighted to see you getting involved.
