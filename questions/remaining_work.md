You have items left in the Sprint Backlog at the end of the Sprint. They are not related to the Sprint Goal you select for the next Sprint. What are you doing with those items? Is it wasteful if we start an item and then not follow through with it? How can waste be reduced? Should we just not start items anymore towards the end of the Sprint if weâ€™re not absolutely sure they can be done?
