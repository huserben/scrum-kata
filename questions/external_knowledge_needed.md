You are the Scrum Master for three Scrum Teams working on the same project. There is one Product Backlog that all three teams must select from. There is one code base. All three Development Teams come to you because they are anticipating a problem in the upcoming two Sprints. Each Development Team needs full time support from an external person, Cindy. Cindy is the only DBA with checkin/checkout permission for the database subschema they will be changing. The Development Teams claim that they can't proceed into these Sprints without Cindy, full time, on their team.
What do you do?
