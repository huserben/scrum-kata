The Scrum Team you work with have missed their Sprint Goal for the last four Sprints. The Developers say this is because the Product Owner isn’t providing enough information on the Product Backlog Items. The Product Owner has heard about something called ‘Product Backlog Refinement’. How would you explain to him what Product Backlog Refinement is? What benefits are there if the Scrum Team start doing regular Product Backlog Refinement?
