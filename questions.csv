title,question
Failure to renegotiate Scope,"During the Sprint, the work turns out to be different than the team expected. The Developers try to collaborate with the PO to renegotiate the scope. But no agreement can be reached that would not affect the Sprint Goal. Should the Sprint be cancelled? "
Metrics in complex environment,"Our goal is to deliver value. To maximize it, teams make measurements and base their future decisions on them. But in a complex environment, how do they know that the change in metrics is caused by their actions and not by a random set of internal and external factors? When are metrics helpful, and when not? "
"Predictability, Risk and Scrum","The Scrum Guide states: ""Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.""  How is predictability optimized with Scrum? How is risk controlled? "
Self-Empowered Teams,What are signs that a Scrum team is empowered? What behaviours can you observe in a self-managing team? What is made possible by empowering a team? 
Not all developers on Daily,What risk is introduced if not all Developers are present for the Daily Scrum?

What is effectiveness?,What is effectiveness? Can it be measured? How can it be increased? 
Harmful Scrum?,Can Scrum be harmful if not used as intended? 
Urgent items vs process improvement,"The Product Owner asks the Developers to pick up a very urgent item late in Sprint that was not in the forecast, nor is it related to the Sprint Goal. The Developers believe it can pick this up, as it is close to meeting the Sprint Goal. But this would involve not meeting their process improvement goal agreed upon during the last Sprint Retrospective. The Product Owner argues that, as it’s the highest priority to satisfy the customer, the needs of the customer have a higher priority than the process improvement goal for the team. "
Postponing Sprint Planning,"The Product Owner suggests postponing the Sprint Planning as she hasn’t yet been able to process all the feedback from the Sprint Review into the Product Backlog. She argues it makes no sense to plan the Sprint if the Product Backlog isn’t in a transparent state. What would you, the Scrum Master, suggest? "
#No DoD,What if a developer refuses to conform to the Definition of Done (DoD)? 
Advice on the Scrum Team size,"A member of the organisation comes to you, the Scrum Master, asking for advice on how to organise the Scrum Teams for an upcoming project.

Birth of an Increment,"In the environment where a team pushes (code) changes frequently to build new versions of the product, is every new version an increment? Are only the versions that move a PBI to Done an increment? Or should we only push code changes if they fully complete a PBI (so that every version becomes a valid increment)? "
Decisions based on the Artifacts,"The Scrum Guide says: ""Important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts"".   How are decisions based on the state of the artifacts? How can low transparency on the artifacts lead to increased risk? "
What Product Backlog Refinement is,The Scrum Team you work with have missed their Sprint Goal for the last four Sprints. The Developers say this is because the Product Owner isn’t providing enough information on the Product Backlog Items. The Product Owner has heard about something called ‘Product Backlog Refinement’. How would you explain to him what Product Backlog Refinement is? What benefits are there if the Scrum Team start doing regular Product Backlog Refinement? 
"Useful, valuable Increment",What makes an Increment valuable? What makes it useful? 
Sum of the Increments,"At the Sprint Review, as stated in the Scrum Guide, ""The sum of the Increments is presented"".  How should this be understood?  Would it be okay to show the second to last Increment in the Review? If so, under what conditions? If not, why not?"
Process improvement vs Organisational policy,A Scrum Team implements a process improvement goal that is not in line with organisational policy and standards. They argue they are self-organising and should be able to break with the ‘old ways’ through small controlled experiments. 
No need for Daily?,"Developers, arguing they are self-organising, indicate they no longer need the Daily Scrum. What would be your reaction as a Scrum Master? "
External knowledge needed,"You are the Scrum Master for three Scrum Teams working on the same project. There is one Product Backlog that all three teams must select from. There is one code base. All three Development Teams come to you because they are anticipating a problem in the upcoming two Sprints. Each Development Team needs full time support from an external person, Cindy. Cindy is the only person with check-in/check-out permission for the database subschema they will be changing. The Development Teams claim that they can't proceed into these Sprints without Cindy, full time, on their team. What do you do?"
Skipping Retrospective upon CEO’s request,"The CEO announces a ‘company event’. The event is scheduled to take place at the same time the Sprint Retrospective is scheduled. As not to ‘limit the impact of this event on the productivity’, the CEO instructs team to cancel, rather than pre- or postpone the Retrospective. She argues: ""They have so many anyways, and this new unique event is also somewhat of an informal gathering"". "
Not enough skills to deliver a Done increment,"The Developers discussed that due to the absence of a Developer, they no longer have all the skills required to deliver a working ""Done"" Increment according to their Definition of Done (DoD). So they decide to adjust the DoD. What will be your reaction to this as the Scrum Master? "

PO challenges the estimate from Developers,"The Product Owner doesn’t understand the estimate given by the Developers regarding a Product Backlog item. The Product Owner is surprised to learn that the item is deemed very complex. The Product Owner refers to an earlier ‘similar’ Product Backlog item, which was not complex at all. How do you, the Scrum Master, proceed? "
Relationships and interactions in Scrum,How are relationships and interactions guided by Scrum? 
Other Goals of Sprint,"The Scrum Guide states: ""Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.""  What other goals are there in the Sprint besides the Sprint Goal?"
Different times for the Daily,"Imagine you work in a team with a few part-time developers. Normally you hold your daily at 09:00, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays, two of the part-time developers only work in the afternoon and therefore can’t join. On the other days, some other people are not available in the afternoon. What would you do as the Scrum Master? "
Skill Acquisition in the Product Backlog,"If the team lacks a skill, is it okay to have items about acquiring that skill (e.g. training, hiring etc.) in the Product Backlog assuming it's needed to improve the Product? "
Not enough details for a Daily Scrum?,"The Scrum Guide states: ""The Sprint Backlog […] should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.""  What if the Sprint Backlog lacks enough details, hindering inspection during the Daily Scrum? What should the team do then?"

Developers don’t prepare for Refinement,"The Product Owner of your Scrum Team reaches out to you asking for help. The latest Backlog Refinement session was cancelled in the middle as everyone felt they were wasting their time - no one reviewed the latest updates of the Product Backlog Items, so the team couldn’t come up with meaningful conversations to refine them. What would be your suggestion in this case? "
#time-boxing,How is time-boxing helpful for self-managing teams?

PO’s over-care of the product backlog ,"The Product Owner is highly conservative over who gets access to the Product Backlog, which is maintained in a personal spreadsheet. He argues that if anyone wants to have access to information about the Product Backlog, they can talk to him directly or join in on scheduled Product Backlog refinement sessions. What would be your reaction to this as the Scrum Master of the team? "
Unexpected finding right before the Sprint Review,"Just prior to the Sprint Review, a Developer determines some aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable. What should the Scrum Team do? "
Artifact Knowledge,Is it relevant that Developers and their Stakeholders are aware of the Scrum Artifacts and understand the purpose behind them? Why or why not? What would be made possible by having this knowledge? 
Key stakeholder missing Sprint Review,"You, as a Scrum Master, spent a fair effort to find a time slot for your team and stakeholders to hold Sprint Reviews. Though, one of your key stakeholders can’t come up with a stable schedule. She already missed the last two sessions, and the team mentioned the lack of feedback for the latest Increment. What will you do to help them out? "
Targets and Goals,"The Scrum Guide states: ""The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against"".  If the Product Goal can serve as a target, does this mean there could also be other targets to plan against besides the Product Goal?"
Emancipating from Scrum?,Is a self-managing team empowered to drop Scrum itself? Or to drop individual events like the Daily Scrum? 
Multiple Whys in Sprint Goal,"The Scrum Guide states: ""The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders"".

Apply & Devise,"The Scrum Guide says: ""As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised"".  What examples could you name, and how can they be helpful for a Scrum Team? Can you think of examples when it could be harmful? "
Improving transparency over the Artifacts,Decisions to optimise value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artifacts. Which Scrum events improve transparency over the artifacts? Explain how. 
Wasteful events,Some of the Developers see Scrum events as a waste of time because nothing comes out of them. The team seems to hold the events because the Scrum Guide says so. How would you approach this situation as the Scrum Master?
What Sprint Review is,One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review. How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism? What would be the impact if some Developers were not present? 
DoD with multiple teams ,"Two Scrum teams are working on the same product to get the increment ready. One Scrum Team targets 80% code coverage, and they are running performance tests. The other Scrum Team leaves the coverage of the code to the discretion of each developer; they do not run performance tests because they consider that User Acceptance tests are much more important. As a Scrum Master, what do you think of this scenario? "
Engaged Group of People,Who and when identifies that the Scrum Team indeed have all the skills and expertise to do the work? How can it be validated at the beginning of the development?

Order vs. Priority, How is ordering a Product Backlog different from prioritizing? 
Conclude & Start,"A Sprint always starts immediately after the previous one concludes, once your Retrospective has concluded. What do you do if you can’t have Sprint Planning right after the Retro (e.g. half of your team has a day off the next day and could not attend the usual planning)? "
No other meetings,The Delivery Manager asks the Scrum Master and Developers not to have meetings outside the Sprint Events because she wants the Developers to write code because this is what they should do. How should the Scrum Master react to such a request? 
Make lack of skills transparent,"If the developers do not have the skills to create an Increment every Sprint, what practices can be used to create as much transparency as possible? "

Coaching Cross-Functionality,How can cross-functionality be coached? 
Done or Not Done,"During a Sprint Review, when Developers are answering questions about the increment, there is a discussion related to work on a specific Product Backlog Item that is not considered ""Done"" by some. The Developers that worked on the item are in disagreement. Some argue it is ""Done"", others argue it is not. "
Remaining Work,You have items left in the Sprint Backlog at the end of the Sprint. They are not related to the Sprint Goal you plan to select for the next Sprint. What will you do with those items? Is it wasteful to start an item and then not follow through with it? How can waste be reduced? Should the team not start items towards the end of the Sprint if they are not sure they can be done? 
Relative Efficacy ,"The Scrum Guide claims: ""Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.""  How is Scrum making visible the relative efficacy of: - Current Management; - Environment; - Work Techniques?"
Three artifacts of the Scrum framework,The Scrum framework identifies three artifacts. What are they? When are they inspected? 
Over-running the time-box,The Developers are regularly over-running the time-box for the Daily Scrum. Some of them appear actively bored. You notice that it is often one team member taking the majority of the time. How would you proceed? 
Container Event,Why is a Sprint needed as a container event? 
Measuring Product Value,How can a Scrum Team measure the value of the product? Is it their accountability to measure it?  
Use of the Product Backlog,How does a Scrum Team use a Product Backlog? 
Committing to uncertainty,The Sprint Goal should provide flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. Yet Developers are supposed to commit to that at the Sprint Planning. How is it possible to commit to something that provides flexibility like this? 
Cherry-Picking Scrum,"How do you deal with the situation where teams/organization pick & choose some parts from Scrum but not others? When approached, they say that those things ""would not work here"" because of... "
Performance review by Scrum Master,"HR is requesting the Scrum Master to provide input for a performance review from one of the members on the team (because Scrum Master is assumed to be closest to the day-to-day performance of people on the team). How do you, the Scrum Master, proceed? "
